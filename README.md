# Introduction
On June 24, 2019, Milan received the momentous announcement in Lausanne, Switzerland, that it would host the 2026 Winter Olympics alongside Cortina d'Ampezzo.
This historic decision marked the beginning of a transformative journey that would extend far beyond sports infrastructure and urban development.
<br>
<br>
Four years later, in 2023, Milano Cortina 2026 took a significant step toward educational legacy by officially launching the GEN26 program.
This comprehensive educational initiative was announced in collaboration with the Italian Ministry of Education and Merit, CONI (Italian National Olympic Committee), and CIP (Italian Paralympic Committee), with the ambitious goal of building bridges between the educational and youth sectors and the sports movement.
<br>
<br>
The GEN26 program has established partnerships with several prestigious Italian universities:
- Università Bocconi
- Università degli studi di Verona
- Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore
- Università IULM Milano
- Politecnico di Milano
These institutions represent just some of the universities involved in the GEN26 project, with the program's reach extending across Italy through strategic partnerships.

### Collaboration Structure
The collaboration operates through multiple interconnected frameworks:
- **CRUI Foundation Partnership:** Milano Cortina 2026 has established a significant partnership with the CRUI Foundation (Italian Conference of University Rectors), which aims to support dual careers in sports and studies while expanding university education and internship opportunities related to the Games.
- **SDA Bocconi Specialized Programs:** A notable collaboration with SDA Bocconi School of Management has resulted in the creation of the Executive Master in Business of Events (EMBE), a twelve-month program designed to develop expertise in major event management.
- **Dual Career Program:** This initiative involves Fondazione Milano Cortina 2026, CONI, CIP, the Minister of Sports and Youth, and the Ministry of Universities and Research, reinforcing and integrating educational values with amateur sports activities.

### Program Impact and Scope
The GEN26 program has demonstrated remarkable reach since its launch:
- **Over 2 million students** engaged across Italy
- **More than 500,000 young people** involved in various projects
- **More than 1,200 participating schools and youth groups**
- Coverage across **20 regions** and **81 provinces** of Italy
